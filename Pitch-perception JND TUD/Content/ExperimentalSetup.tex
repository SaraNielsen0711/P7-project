\section*{Experimental setup}
To use a transformed 1-up/2-down method of adjustment a programme in MatLab was constructed. A flowchart over the programme and the script can be seen in \autoref{flowchart og kode}. Other equiptment used for the study is a pair of Bang $\&$ Olufsen H6 headphones and a Lenovo Thinkpad with a fixed 10 \% volume.

Two tones are presented and after listening to them the test subject chooses which of the tones is highest by typing either 1 og 2 in the command window (evt figur). The experiment was conducted in a group room located on the 1st floor of Fredrik Bajers vej 7B, B2-207. \autoref{figur} illustrates the experimental setup. 

\subsection*{Test subjects}
Five test subjects were used in the test including two males and three females in the age of 23 to 24 (mean = 23.4). All of the test subjects are Enginerring Psychology students at Aalborg University.
