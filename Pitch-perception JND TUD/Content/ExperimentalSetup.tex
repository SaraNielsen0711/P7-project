\section*{Experimental setup}
%
To conduct the test with a \textit{Transformed 1-Up/2-Down Method} a program in MatLab was constructed. A flowchart over the program can be seen in \autoref{app:Flowchart} and the script for the program can be seen in \autoref{app:Script}. Other equipment used in the experimental setup is a pair of Bang $\&$ Olufsen H6 headphones and a Dell Latitude 6430u Ultrabook with a fixed 10 \% volume.

Two tones are presented to the test subject. After listening to the two tones the test subject chooses which of the two tones he or she perceives to have the highest pitch. The subject chooses by typing either "1" (for the first presented tone) or "2" (for the last presented tone) on the keyboard and in the command window in MatLab (evt figur).\blankline

The test subjects were instructed to wear the headphones during the test and listen to the two tones. They were instructed to provide their response by pressing either "1", if they perceived the first tone to have the highest pitch, or "2", if they perceived the second tone to have the highest pitch. This is done in MatLabs command window. After a press on either "1" or "2" they were instructed to press enter, after which the next trial would be presented.\blankline

The experiment was conducted in group room B2-207 located on the 1st floor of Fredrik Bajers vej 7B at Aalborg University. On \autoref{fig:experiment} the experimental setup is illustrated.
