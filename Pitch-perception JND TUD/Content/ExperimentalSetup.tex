\section*{Experimental setup}
%
To conduct the test with a \textit{Transformed Up/Down Method} a program in MatLab was constructed. A flowchart over the program can be seen in \autoref{app:Flowchart} and the script for the program can be seen in \autoref{app:Script}. Other equipment used in the experimental setup is a pair of Bang $\&$ Olufsen H6 headphones and a Dell Latitude 6430u Ultrabook with a fixed 10 \% volume.

Two tones are presented to the test subject. After listening to the two tones the test subject chooses which of the two tones he or she believes to have the highest pitch. The subject chooses by typing either "1" (for the first presented tone) or "2" (for the last presented tone) on the keyboard and in the command window in MatLab (evt figur).\blankline
