\section*{Experimental setup}
A program in MatLab was constructed to conduct the test with a \textit{Transformed 1-Up/2-Down Method}. A flowchart over the program can be seen in \autoref{app:Flowchart} and the script for the program can be seen in \autoref{app:Script}. Other equipment used in the experimental setup is a pair of Bang $\&$ Olufsen H6 headphones and a Dell Latitude 6430u Ultrabook with a fixed 10 \% volume.

Two tones are presented to the test subject. The subject is then asked in the command window which of the two stimuli had the highest pitch. The subject is instructed to either enter "1" (for the first presented tone) or "2" (for the last presented tone) in the command window in MatLab.\blankline

The experiment was conducted in group room B2-207 located on the 1st floor of Fredrik Bajers vej 7B at Aalborg University and the test subjects were instructed to wear the headphones during the test and listen to the two tones. On \autoref{fig:experiment} the experimental setup is illustrated.
