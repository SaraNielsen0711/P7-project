\section*{Experimental setup}
To use a transformed 1-up/2-down method of adjustment a programme in MatLab was constructed. A flowchart over the programme and the script can be seen in \autoref{flowchart og kode}. Other equiptment used for the study is a pair of Bang $\&$ Olufsen H6 headphones and a Lenovo Thinkpad with a fixed 10 \% volume.

Two tones are presented and after listening to them the test subject chooses which of the tones is highest by typing either 1 og 2 in the command window (evt figur).
