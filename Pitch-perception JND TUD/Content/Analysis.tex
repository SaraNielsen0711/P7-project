\section*{Analysis}
A 2-AFC method is used to collect data which leaves a 50 \% chance of guessing the right answer of the two possibilities. The point for JND is read at 70.7 \% because of the transformed method 1-up/2-down where you have to guess right two times in a row for $\Delta$f to decrease.
\%

From the fitted psychometric function for each subject the JND is read at 70.7 \% correct answered. In \autoref{tab:JND} the individual test subjects JND are presented along with a calculated mean JND which is xx Hz.

From Webers law the Weber fraction, \textit{k}, can be calculated. According to this sample, the smallest detectable change in pitch perception, \textit{$\Delta$I}, is the mean JND at xx, when compared to the physical stimulus intensity, \textit{I}, of 800 Hz.
% 
\begin{equation}
xx = k \cdot 800 Hz \Rightarrow k = \frac{xx}{800 Hz} = xx
\end{equation}
%
This Weber fraction allows for calculating differential threshold at other intensities, \textit{I}.
