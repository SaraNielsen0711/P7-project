\chapter*{Pitch perception JND}
%
This paper aims to do a comparison of two stimuli presentation methods by comparing the measured differential threshold of pitch perception, known as the Just Noticeable Difference (JND). The two methods used are the \textit{Method of Constant Stimuli} and the \textit{Transformed Up/Down Method}. Webers law states that the smallest detectable change in perception, $\Delta$\textit{I}, is equal to a constant, \textit{k}, times the physical stimulus intensity, \textit{I}.
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta I= k \cdot I
\end{equation}
%
The constant, \textit{k}, is known as the Weber Fraction for a particular sensory dimension.
