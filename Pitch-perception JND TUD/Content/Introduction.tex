\chapter*{Pitch perception JND}
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference threshold, known as Just Noticeable Difference (JND), of pitch perception using method of adjustment. Webers law states that the smallest detectable change in perception, $\Delta$\textit{I}, is equal to a constant, \textit{k}, times the physical stimulus intensity, \textit{I}.

\begin{equation}
\Delta I= k \cdot I
\end{equation}

The constant, \textit{k}, is known as the Weber Fraction for a particular sensory dimension.
