\section*{Results and Analysis}
\label{Results}
%
%Analyze the results from the example using PCA.

%First plot a “profile” of all stimuli.

%How much of the variance is explained by each component?

%(Plot a scree-plot including cumulative variance).

%Plot your PCA solution graphically. Both a plot with just your stimuli (scores) and a biplot with both scores and loadings.

%Make a table of the loadings of each word-pair on each principal component.

%Interpret the solution. Also, are there word-pairs that seem ”redundant” e.g. measures that same perceptual attribute?
