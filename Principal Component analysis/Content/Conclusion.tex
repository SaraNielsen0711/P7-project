\section*{Conclusion}

The data for \textit{Men and Bread} is analysed using Principal Component Analysis. The results from this analysis shows that the attribute ``Krumme'' contributes to most of the PC1 with a loading value at 0.5472. The attribute ``Kerner'' contributes to most of the PC2 with a loading value at 0.6974. \blankline

A bi-plot was made for both two and three dimensions. Based on the three dimensions bi-plot it looks like the attributes ``Nærende'', ``Mættende'' and ``Skorpe'' are highly correlated, therefore these three attributes might be redundant. \blankline

The attribute ``Saftig'' doesn't really contribute to any of the three principal components and according to \autoref{fig:plot} the rating of this attribute doesn't vary that much between the different buns which also indicates that this attribute isn't that important for this PCA.
