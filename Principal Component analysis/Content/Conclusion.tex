\section*{Conclusion}

The data for \textit{Men and Bread} was analysed using Principal Component Analysis. The results from this analysis shows that the attribute "Krumme" contributes to most of the PC1 with a loading value at 0.5472. PC1 accounts for 81.04\% of the explained variance. The attribute "Kerner" contributes to most of the PC2 with a loading value at 0.6974. PC2 explains 13.61\% of the explained variance. \blankline

A bi-plot was made for both two and three dimensions. Based on the three dimension bi-plot it looks like the attributes "Nærende", "Mættende", and "Skorpe" are highly correlated, therefore one of these three attributes might be redundant. \blankline

The attribute "Saftig" does not really contribute to any of the three principal components and according to \autoref{fig:plot} the rating of this attribute does not vary that much between the different buns which also indicates that this attribute is not that important for this PCA.
