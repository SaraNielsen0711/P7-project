{\parskip 5pt   
This study originates from a social robot research project at Aalborg University with the aim of developing and implementing robots in a variety of contexts. This raises questions as to how social robots should behave and which variables are important when implementing a social robot in a public setting. Important variables can be elicited via user interaction and tested via scales. The study consists of two tests, one where variables are elicited and one where the scales are used to evaluate the experience the human robot interaction (HRI). %, so possible correlation can be detected.

\headerbox{Methods}
{name=method,span=1,column=0,below=introduction, span=1}
{\parskip 5pt 
Two tests were set up in Aalborg Airport (AAL) to investigate which variables are important for the HRI with a social robot and to develop scales based on them. Both tests were conducted on Danish Travellers who interacted with a \textit{Double} robot shown on figure 1.\\
\textbullet~ \textbf{Subject recruitment} was done by the robot which approached potential subjects (travellers) and presented a wireframed interface asking if it may help with wayfinding. If the traveller accepted  they were led towards their chosen destination until an experimenter stopped them. The \textit{Double} robot was remotely controlled via a computer by a present researcher. This approach was similar in both tests and was done to provide a more ecological and undisturbed interaction between robot and subject.\\
\textbullet~ \textbf{Test 1}: Subjects were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview about their first impressions after the interaction while observational data was gathered during the interaction. \\
\textbullet~ \textbf{Test 2}: Subjects were asked to rate their interactions on the developed scales on a PC after their unsolicited interaction.
%In the first test subjects were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview about their first impressions after the interaction and in the second test subjects were asked to rate their interactions on the developed scales. The \textit{Double} robot was remotely controlled via a computer and a present controller. On the screen a developed wireframe to help with wayfinding in AAL was presented.

\vspace{-15pt}  

%The subjects were recruited by the robot, which provides a more ecological and undisturbed interaction between robot and subject. The robot approached potential subjects after the security check and asked to help travellers with wayfinding. If travellers wanted help, they were presented with four wayfinding options: Food, Shopping, Toilets or Gate information. After the interaction the robot led subjects to an interviewer. 

%\textbullet~ \textbf{Data Processing}
%From the first test the interviews and observations were coded into affinity notes and an affinity diagram was made. This affinity diagram is pivotal in eliciting the variables that affect HRI, and thereafter in creating the scales to be used for further work. 
%567 affinity notes were sorted into 10 green categories with individual subcategories.

24 variables were elicited, where 23 of them are used to evaluate the HRI and one is used as demographic information about subjects. All 24 variables are evaluated on a Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). The 23 used to evaluate the interaction is shown on figure 2.

Results from the second test is analysed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with groupings relating to the robot's height, distance from subject and approach direction. Figure 5 shows a biplot from PCA.

\textbf{Figure~5. }Biplot showing how the different variables contributes to components and which variables correlates. The black numbers relates the the SQ and the red to the different heights.
\vspace{-5pt}

%From the biplots, the variables that correlates positive relating to height is: SQ10-SQ13, SQ12-SQ18, SQ14-SQ15, and SQ8-SQ17. The negative correlation relating to height is: SQ12-SQ21, SQ18-SQ21, SQ2-SQ9, SQ4-SQ9, and SQ16-SQ19. Variables correlating positive relating to distance is: SQ1-SQ12, SQ7-SQ17, SQ10-SQ22, and SQ8-SQ21. The negative correlation relating to distance is: SQ2-SQ9, SQ14-SQ16, SQ10-SQ13, SQ13-SQ22, SQ5-SQ21, and SQ19-SQ20. Variables correlating positive relating to direction is: SQ8-SQ10, SQ9-SQ14, and SQ5-SQ7. The negative correlation relating to direction is: SQ1-SQ12, SQ9-SQ10, SQ10-SQ14, SQ6-SQ23, and SQ13-SQ21. 

From the PCA positive and negative correlations is found. This is done relating to the robot's height, distance and direction, respectively, and are as follows:\\
\textbullet~\textbf{Height (pos):}  SQ10-SQ13, SQ12-SQ18, SQ14-SQ15, SQ8-SQ17\\
\textbullet~\textbf{Height (neg):} SQ12-SQ21, SQ18-SQ21, SQ2-SQ9, SQ4-SQ9, SQ16-SQ19\\
\textbullet~\textbf{Distance (pos):} SQ1-SQ12, SQ7-SQ17, SQ10-SQ22, SQ8-SQ21\\
\textbullet~\textbf{Distance (neg):} SQ2-SQ9, SQ14-SQ16, SQ10-SQ13, SQ13-SQ22, SQ5-SQ21, SQ19-SQ20\\
\textbullet~\textbf{Direction (pos):} SQ8-SQ10, SQ9-SQ14, SQ5-SQ7\\
\textbullet~\textbf{Direction (neg):} SQ1-SQ12, SQ9-SQ10, SQ10-SQ14, SQ6-SQ23, SQ13-SQ21
%From the biplots, the first bulletpoint is variables that correlates positive and the second is variables that correlates negative when doing PCA related to heights:

%\textbullet~SQ10-SQ13, SQ12-SQ18, SQ14-SQ15, SQ8-SQ17\\
%\textbullet~ SQ12-SQ21, SQ18-SQ21, SQ2-SQ9, SQ4-SQ9, SQ16-SQ19\\
%\vspace{-5pt}

%\textbullet~SQ1-SQ12, SQ7-SQ17, SQ10-SQ22, SQ8-SQ21\\

\headerbox{Conclusion}
{name=conclusion,span=1,column=3,below=results3}
{\parskip 5pt
This research conducted in this study reveals that there are at least 24 variables that Danish travellers find important when interacting with a social robot. Scales and scale questions are devoped based on these variables and results show that subjects are able to understand these with a few exeptions. Furthermore some of these variables have positive and negative correlation, which can mean that some of the questions are redundant and covers the same areas or that variables depend on each other such that subjects like to be served by the robot when they find it exciting.
