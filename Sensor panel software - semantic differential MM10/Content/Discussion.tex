Overall it seems like the subjects were able to assign fitting scores for each attribute. The software  \textit{PanelCheck} allow easy access to a vast variety of statistical methods and visualisations. However it does take away some of the freedom seen in other software such as R or Matlab. It is not easy to change the appearance e.g. if another colour scheme is preferable or the labels are badly placed. Often the labels are placed on top of each other making it impossible to read. \textit{PanelCheck} is an easy to use tool but it could use some more documentation on the different plots. It is not hard to imagine using an easy generated plot only to misinterpret it.
