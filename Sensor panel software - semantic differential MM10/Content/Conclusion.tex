\section*{Conclusion}
\textit{PanelCheck} is an easy to use software and statistical tool but could do with some more documentation and customisation in the form of editing labels, colours etc.. With the help of \textit{PanelCheck} it was found out that the assessors disagreed on the attribute "Dark-Light". The attribute "Symmetrical-Asymmetrical" had a very low SD and the assessors seemed to agree that all speakers shown were symmetrical. All the assessors' answers were significantly different from each other in one or more attribute ratings. By using \textit{PanelCheck} it is possible to compare the attribute ratings for two different speakers to figure out where the difference lies. An example was shown and found that the speakers BeoLab 4000 and the BeoLab 6000 were rated significantly different from one another on the following attributes: ""Low-Tall", "Light-Dark", and "Wide-Narrow". A spider-plot was used to identify each speakers attribute profile and a plot containing PCA Correlation loadings showed that there most likely exists correlation between the attributes: "Light-Heavy", "Small-Big",  "Low-Tall", "Narrow-Wide", and "Fragile-Robust" and again between "Soft-Hard" and "Feminine-Masculine" repectively where the latter group showed the strongest correlation.
