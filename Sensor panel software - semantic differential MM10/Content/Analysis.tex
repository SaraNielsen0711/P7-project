It is possible to look at a spider plot in order to get a sense of how the speakers were rated overall. For example the BeoLab 5 overall scores the highest in the attributes: \textit{Flashy}, \textit{Decorated}, \textit{Wide}, \textit{Untypical}. This seems reasonable when presented with the speakers next to each other in \autoref{fig:speakers}.
