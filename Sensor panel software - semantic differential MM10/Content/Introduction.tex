This paper aims to analyse data obtained from \cite{Christiansen2011} where they tested the influence of a loudspeaker's appearance and the perceived sound quality on 20 subjects with 16 bipolar word-pairs on open ended Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Half of the dataset has been replicated so that more data-points are available . The objective is to analyse the semantic difference between the answers using the censor panel software PanelCheck and gain experience working with the software. Multiple plots will be presented and analysed.
