Analyse the dataset ”facial expressions” using MDS in Matlab (assume ordinal data).What type of MDS should you use? Argue for choice. How many dimensions should you use? Plot scree plot.How good a fit is your solution? Plot Shepard plot and interpret it.Hint! Look in documentation for Multidimensional scaling in Matlab. It has some nice code examples.Hint! The example for the Shepard plot requires the data tobe on vector form instead of matrix form. You can convertusing the function squareform(). Example: $facial_vector=squareform(facial);$Can you find meaningful dimensions? Label them. Must be send to me before mm 7 (10.00 at the latest!)
