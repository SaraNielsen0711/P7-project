Based on the results presented in the previous section it is possible to analyse how well a fit the BTL and preference tree are.\blankline

The number of possible stocastic violations in the data is 20, and from theese one moderate and five strong stocastic violations was found. This combined with the Chi-square test, which calculated a p-value at 0.0055, showed that a BTL-model would not be a good fit. Instead a preference tree was made.\blankline

As mentioned different types of preference trees was testet, but only two preference trees had a p-value high enough to fit. Theese two preference trees is shown on \autoref{fig:} and \autoref{fig:}
