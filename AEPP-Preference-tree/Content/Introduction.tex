\section*{Introduction}
\label{Introduktion}

The purpose of this article is to analyse data about the perceived health risk of six different drugs, using either the probabilistic choice model BTL or Preference Tree. It will be tested which one of the two models that fits the best. The data that will be analysed is shown in \autoref{tab:data}, where the absolute frequencies used in a cumulative preference matrix is presented. The scores denote how many participants voted the drug in question as being of the highest health risk.
