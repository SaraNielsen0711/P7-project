The conclusion is that the BTL-model with a p-value at 0.0055 does not fit the data and the Preference Tree is used to analyse the data instead. There were found two different Preference Trees that fitted, with p-values at 0.1220 and 0.1414. Both of the trees has alcohol in its own branch which indicates that it is rated different than the other five drugs. Cannabis and Tobacco was shown to be rated at the same level for both trees. The last three drugs were structured different between the two trees, the first tree had these three drug on the same level and the other tree, which were found to be the better fit, had cocaine in one branch and heroin and ecstasy on same level in another.
