The Preference model is used to analyse the data. This kind of model is a bit harder to interpret, but gives a good representation on how the drugs can be compared. It can be difficult to make a preference tree which fits with the data, especially if the analyst don't have the same mental idea of the health risk of drugs as the participants. A lot of different Preference Trees including branches as legal and illegal, organic and chemically manufactured was suggested, but non of these was a found to be a fit. \blankline

The two preference trees found only has p-values on 0.12 and 0.14 respectively. These aren't very high p-values and a preference tree fitting even better might be found if all possible relations was tested. \blankline

As shown in \fullref{Analyse} heroin is considered to be of a higher health risk than any other drug in this study. Cocaine and ecstasy is also rated to have a high health risk compared to alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, but not as high as heroin.

As seen on both Preference Trees alcohol has a branch for itself, which indicates that this can't be compared with any of the other drugs. The Preference Trees also shows that both tobacco and cannabis, even though grouped with the harder drugs, are evaluated to be of lower health risk than alcohol.
