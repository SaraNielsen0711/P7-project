The number of SST violations was a bit high, namely 25 out of 129 possible violations. This account for 16.2\% out of the possible violations. There does not exist a definitive rule which defines the acceptable amount of SST violations before the BTL-model does not fit. However, the number of WST and MST violations was low, two and three respectively. The low number of WST violations is contributing to the opinion that the BTL-model fits well with the data. If this is the case, according to \textcite[p. 213]{Zimmer2003} the test subjects compared the unpleasantness of the ten sounds according to the same criterions.
