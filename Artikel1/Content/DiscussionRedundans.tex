\subsection{Redundancy}
%
Some of the attributes might be redundant if they correlate with other attributes having similar overall characteristics. This relates to attributes such as cool and funny, which might be redundant when also asking subjects about how cute and exciting they found the robot. This is due to the correlations, but also the word funny, which can be widely used, e.g. as humorous funny or weird funny. Attributes like how safe subjects felt using the robot could be combined with how much they relied on the robot leading them to the chosen location under a shared trust attribute. Asking subjects how trustworthy they found the robot and how much they felt it could help them could then give an impression on the three attributes by only asking two questions. Furthermore, attributes such as SQ12 (like being served by the robot) might be redundant when asking subjects how exciting and intrusive they found the robot.
