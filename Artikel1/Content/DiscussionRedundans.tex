\subsection{Redundancy}
%
Some of the attributes might be redundant, if they correlate with other attributes having similar and covering characteristics. This relates to attributes as like being served by the robot, which might be redundant when asking how subjects how exciting and intrusive they found it. Attributes like cool and funny might be redundant when also asking subjects about how cute and exciting they found the robot. This is due to the correlations, but also the word funny, which can be used widely, e.g. as humorous funny or wierd funny. Furthermore attributes like how safe subjects felt using the robot and could be compared with how much they counted on the robot leading them to the chosen location under a trust attribute. Asking subjects how trustworthy they found the robot and how much they felt it could help them could then give an impression on the three attributes by only asking two questions.
