Due to the Marvel wireframe running inside the \textit{Double} application, the touch screen was less responsive than expected. This resulted in some travellers not wanting further interaction with the robot. It also affected the experience for those who chose to interact with it anyway.

The scaling software written for the second test had some response issues as well, which ultimately led to incomplete datasets because the program often failed to notice mouse-clicks. This is not ideal for a scale which relies on an immediate impulse response without much thought. This have almost definitely changed some subjects' responses in either direction of the scale due to them clicking in another location on the scale than initially chosen.
