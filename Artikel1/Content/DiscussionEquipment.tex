Due to the Marvel wireframe running inside the double app, the touchscreen was less responsive than expected. This resulted in some people not wanting to interact with the robot, but also it affected the experience for those who chose to interact with it anyway.

Controlling the robot in a busy area of the airport proved to be more dificult than expected. It was hard to control it through the camera, which meant that the controller had to do it by looking directly at the robot. It had to be controlled from a distance of approximately 10 meters, and sometimes travellers walked in front of the robot and blocked the visibility for the controller. Also, the controller had to be very cautious not to run into anyone. This resulted in a somewhat hesitating appearance of the robot. For example, subject xx said that the robot should move more smoothly and adapt its movement to the people surrounding it. Subject xx said that the robot appeared hesitating.
