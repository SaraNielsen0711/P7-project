Due to the Marvel wireframe running inside the double application, the touchscreen was less responsive than expected. This resulted in some travellers not wanting to interact with the robot, but also it affected the experience for those who chose to interact with it anyway.

Controlling the robot in a busy area of the airport proved to be more difficult than expected. It was hard to control it via the camera, which meant that the controller had to do it by looking directly at the robot. It had to be controlled from a distance of approximately 10 meters, and sometimes travellers walked in front of the robot and occluded the visibility for the controller. Also, the controller had to be very cautious about the robot not running into anyone. This resulted in a somewhat hesitating appearance of the robot. For example, subject 03 said that the robot appeared hesitating and that it should move smoothly and adapt its movement to the people surrounding it.
