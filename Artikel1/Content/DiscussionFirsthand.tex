\subsection{First impression}
%
The results of this study were based entirely on the subjects' first impression of the robot. The long term experience of interacting with the robot remains unknown. Several subjects interacted with the robot, because it was new and exciting and made them curious, which might be explained by the novelty effect. Their user experience and focus points might change relative to their familiarity with the robot and therefore different attributes might be elicited when conducting a study not only regarding first impression.
