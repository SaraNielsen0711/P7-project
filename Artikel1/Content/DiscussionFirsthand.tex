%\sout{The answers were based entirely on the subjects superficial first impression of the robot. The longitudinal experience of interacting with the robot remains unknown. Several subjects interacted with the robot, because it was new and exciting and made them curious. This might come down to a novelty factor. They might not want to use the robot for solving an actual problem. This could change the experience and make potential users focus more on other areas of the experience.}

The development of the scales and evaluation of them are conducted in a specific context where the robot is a new object. The results of this study is therefore based on first impressions of the robot and the subjects not having previous experience with robots in this specific context. If this study is to be replicated, it is relevant to be aware of the subjects experiences with robots in the context because it is expected to influence the experience of the robot. 
An attempt was made in the second test to mediate this problem by asking them how fond they were of technology. Still it is a broad question and does not specifically clarify whether or not they have had experience with robots before.\fxnote{Jeg er ikke sikker på jeg forstår de her to linjer - Lucca}
