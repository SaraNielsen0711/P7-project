\subsection{Labels and anchor points}
%Diskussion omkring labels
Taking a closer look at SQ5 and SQ7 it is clear that subjects are answering just around or on the midpoint regardless of the height of the robot or how close to them it stops. Both attributes have shown to have an impact on the experience of interacting with robots both in this study and in the reviewed literature. Perhaps the midpoint and the label \textit{fine} should be reconsidered since it seems to be too broadly describing. The answers would likely be more dispersed if no label was given. The closed anchor points used on the scales can induce accumulation of data points around these. Also the use of bipolar scales poses the risk of picking two words which are not  each others opposite.\fxnote{Hertil skal der skrives noget mere --- er det fint nok nu, Luccaaaaaaaa????????}
