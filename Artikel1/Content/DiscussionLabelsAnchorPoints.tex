\subsection{Labels and scale questions}
%
It appears that there were some confusion regarding some of the scales e.g. where SQ05 was misinterpreted. The question was meant as to how close the robot stopped in relation to the subject but some subjects thought it was meant in relation to their chosen location which they obviously could not answer. A few also commented on the attribute funny and cute. Some subjects expressed, that the robot was funny, but not comedic funny and therefore had trouble rating the scale question because of this duality. Another subject commented that she refused to rate the robot as cute, because she regarded it as a human quality and that she refused to humanise the robot.
