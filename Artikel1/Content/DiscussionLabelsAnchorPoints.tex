Taking a closer look at SQ5 and SQ7 it is clear that subjects are answering just around or on the midpoint regardless of the height of the robot or how close to them it stops. The two variables have shown to have an impact on the experience of interacting with robots both in this study and in the reviewed literature. Perhaps the midpoint and the label \textit{fine} should be reconsidered since it seems to be too broadly a description of especially height for Danish travellers. The closed anchor points used on the scales can induce accumulation of data points around these \fxnote{Hertil skal der skrives noget mere}
