Real travellers were observed interacting with a robot in AAL and interviewed in order to get a sense of peoples' experience and the words they use to describe interacting with a robot in an airport. In total 30 travellers, including 16 women and 14 men, was interviewed during 18 interviews. 11 interviews were performed including a single traveller, where the remaining seven was done on groups of two or more. The participants' ages range from 8 to 62 years (M=37.9, SD=17.1) and have all been travelling more than once.

During the tests a Double robot was used from Double Robotics Inc. Double is basically a segway merged with an iPad and in this study a new head mount was used, so that the iPad was tilted upwards towards the participants, see figure (inds√¶t billede af double og referencen hertil). Travellers were shown a wireframe on the iPad, intended to help them find a location in the airport of their choosing. In order to create a natural experience, the robot was used to recruit participants by asking them if it could help them find their way around AAL. When travellers were willing to participate the robot led them to the interviewer instead of the chosen gate or restaurant. By doing this, the interviewer could start the interview by asking participants how their first meeting with the robot was without having to first set the scene for the participants and interfering with the natural first impression.

The user experience is then documented like a contextual field study with observations and a semi-structured interview. The interviews are then transcribed and affinity notes are made for building an affinity diagram. By building an affinity diagram these notes can be sorted into a hierarchy of different categories and subcategories, which will tell the user's perspective of the interaction. The affinity diagram represent some of the main areas that are important for travellers when interacting with the robot. These areas are used to create scales, which then are tested with new users in the airport. After gathering data on the chosen parameters, it can then be evaluated in which degree the different attributes contribute to the overall experience of the interaction and how they relate to each other.
