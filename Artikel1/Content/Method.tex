\section{Method}
\label{Method}
The underlying purpose of the study is to observe potential users interacting with a dummy robot in a setting and environment which resemble the use situation. In this case the setting is in Aalborg Airport (AAL) and the potential users are the travellers. The travellers who interact with the robot are asked to participate in a semi-structured interview about their first impressions all the while being observed. 

\subsection{Materials}
For the study a Double 1 robot from Double Robotics Inc. with an iPad Air is used. The iPad has a wireframe interface from marvel (\url{www.marvelapp.com}) made to look like a wayfinding tool in the airport. The Double 1 was connected to a PC via WiFi connection and its own software. The Double 1 software allows a link to be displayed containing a web-page with the wireframe on the iPad while the observer still is able to control the Double 1 from the PC. It is not possible to control the Double 1 when an application other than the Double 1 software is running.

\subsection{Subject Recruitment}
 The subjects are recruited by the robot itself which is remote controlled by an observer present. The observer who controls the robot approaches the potential subjects. The wireframe on the iPad asks the subjects if it may help them find their way around AAL and presents a "Yes" or "No" option. If "Yes" is pressed, then the subjects are presented with four wayfinding options: Food, Shopping, Toilets, or Gate. The subjects are then asked to kindly follow the robot after they have chosen their preferred option. The robot then leads the subjects to an observer who shortly informs them of the study and receive verbal consent to record audio during a semi-structured interview.
 
 \subsection{The interview}
 semi-structured, in two parts, prepared specific questions relating to height, speed, etc.

\subsection{Methods (affinity, contextual inquiry)}













%Real travellers were observed interacting with a robot in AAL and interviewed in order to get a sense of peoples' experience and the words they use to describe interacting with a robot in an airport. In total 30 travellers, including 16 women and 14 men, was interviewed during 18 interviews. 11 interviews were performed including a single traveller, where the remaining seven was done on groups of two or more. The participants' ages range from 8 to 62 years (M=37.9, SD=17.1) and have all been travelling more than once.

%During the tests a Double robot was used from Double Robotics Inc. Double is basically a segway merged with an iPad and in this study a new head mount was used, so that the iPad was tilted upwards towards the participants, see figure (inds√¶t billede af double og referencen hertil). Travellers were shown a wireframe on the iPad, intended to help them find a location in the airport of their choosing. In order to create a natural experience, the robot was used to recruit participants by asking them if it could help them find their way around AAL. When travellers were willing to participate the robot led them to the interviewer instead of the chosen gate or restaurant. By doing this, the interviewer could start the interview by asking participants how their first meeting with the robot was without having to first set the scene for the participants and interfering with the natural first impression.

%The user experience is then documented like a contextual field study with observations and a semi-structured interview. The interviews are then transcribed and affinity notes are made for building an affinity diagram. By building an affinity diagram these notes can be sorted into a hierarchy of different categories and subcategories, which will tell the user's perspective of the interaction. The affinity diagram represent some of the main areas that are important for travellers when interacting with the robot. These areas are used to create scales, which then are tested with new users in the airport. After gathering data on the chosen parameters, it can then be evaluated in which degree the different attributes contribute to the overall experience of the interaction and how they relate to each other.
