\section{Method}
\label{Method2}
The test was conducted over the course of two days and otherwise as described in \autoref{MethodElicitation}. The location stayed the same along with the overall procedure. This time, in stead of being led to an interview by the robot, the subjects were led a small distance in the direction of most of the available options in the wireframe (Food, Shopping, Gates). Here an experimenter politely stopped them and informed them about the ongoing study. After they accepted to participate, they were led to a PC nearby to rate their experience on the developed scales . An observer was ready to take notes while they rated.

\subsection{Materials}
The same materials were used as described in \autoref{MethodElicitation}.  Additionally a program \fxnote{Software i stedet?} was developed in Processing (\url{www.processing.org}) to be able to collect data from the scales. The program was presented on a PC with a simple wireless mouse.

\subsection{Subject Recruitment}
Over the course of two days, 43 subjects participated aged from 10 to 72 (M=40.14, SD=13.25) distributed among 18 females and 25 males. The subjects were again recruited by the robot.

\subsection{Scale Program}
The scale program consisted of 23 scales distributed on 7 pages. The maximum amount of scales presented on a single page was four and minimum two. The subjects were instructed set a fitting marker on the scales using the provided mouse. The scales were ordered to be as consistent on each page as possible e.g. the same type of scale with a mid-point
