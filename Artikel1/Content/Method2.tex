\section{Method - Scale Testing}
\label{Method2}
The test was conducted over the course of two days and as described in \autoref{MethodElicitation}. However in this test instead of being led by the robot to an interview, the subjects were led a small distance in the direction of Duty Free where most of the available options in the wireframe were (Food, Shopping, Gates). An experimenter politely stopped them and informed them about the ongoing study. After they accepted to participate, they were led to a PC nearby to rate their experience on the developed scales. The experimenter was ready to take notes while they rated. The order in which the scales were presented is described in \autoref{ResultsElicitation}. The physical parameters of the robot were varied over the course of the test. This included: The angle of approach, the robot height (and speed), and the distance to the subjects. As a consequence of the study being ecologically performed in an actual airport it was not possible to precisely control the distance to the subjects or the angle of approach. These had to rely on subjective judgement from the researchers. Height was measured using a measuring tape. The robot height was set to either of the following five heights: 118 cm, 123.5 cm, 129 cm, 140 cm, or 151 cm. The first and last mentioned heights are dictated by the robot's minimum and maximum height, whereas 129 cm was chosen according to what the subjects in previous study mentioned as fine, which corresponds to human elbow height according to mean height of the Danish population. 

\subsection{Materials}
The same materials were used as described in \autoref{MethodElicitation} along with the same \textit{Double} and tilted headmount. Additionally, software was developed in Processing 3.3.6 (\url{www.processing.org}) to be able to collect data from the scales. The program was presented on a \textit{Microsoft Surface Pro (5)} with a simple wireless mouse. The 24th scale was presented on a sheet of paper along with a few questions to collect demographic information.

\subsection{Scale Program}
The scale program consisted of 23 scales distributed on seven pages. The number of scales presented on a single page were maximum four and minimum two. The subjects were instructed to set a marker representing their response on the scales using the provided mouse. The scales were organised to be as consistent on each page as possible e.g. the same type of scales with a midpoint were presented on one page but internally the scales were organised such that two similar parameters did not appear right after each other.

\subsection{Subject Recruitment}
Over the course of two days 43 subjects participated. They were aged from 10 to 72 (M=40.1, SD=13.4) and distributed among 16 females and 27 males. Subjects reported that they travel between 1 and 100 times per year (M=15.3, SD=18.1). The subjects were again recruited by the robot with the same wireframe as in the previous test.

\subsection{Roles}
Four researchers were present during the test at AAL. One controlled the \textit{Double} robot, one instructed the subjects to answer the scales, one observed when the robot should start leading the subjects towards Duty Free and one noted the physical parameters of the robot such as height, direction of approach, and distance to the subjects.

\subsection{Data Processing}
Data was gathered in Processing 3.3.6 and for each subject data were saved in a .csv format and analysed using both Matlab and Rstudio. Data were analysed using boxplots and multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which were further analysed in order to compare correlated parameters. The subjects were generally categorised in three groups (three groups within age, height ratio, distance, direction etc.) in order to assess how the subjects responded to the physical changes of the robot \fxnote{rettes til}.
