\section{Results - Scale Testing}
\label{ResultsScaleTesting}
%
Due to a programming error the dataset contains several zero-answers which could happen when subjects did not answer on a scale. It was decided to remove the missing answers. Two criteria were used to determine when to exclude some of the zero-points that occurred because of a non-answered scale. 1) If all scale ratings presented on one of the pages are zero, it was probably because subjects skipped a page and 2) If there is a strong tendency for high ratings on a scale and a single zero-answer seems unlikely, it was denoted as a missing answer.\\

\noindent
The different ratings on the scales in the second test are visualised on \autoref{fig:Boxplot}.

From \autoref{fig:Boxplot} it is notable that there exists much greater variation in some scales compared to others. For some SQs, a big part of the scale is used (1, 4, 8, 12, 14, 19), where for others a smaller part of the scale is used (2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16). Furthermore some of the scale ratings appears normal distributed (1, 2, 6, 17, 20, 21) and others appears skewed (8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 18). In some SQs the data accumulates around midpoints or anchor points (5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16). SQ05 and SQ07 are centralised around the midpoint, which for SQ07 can relate to the label \textit{fine} being too broadly describing. The closed anchor points used on the scales can induce accumulation of data points around these. Also the use of bipolar scales poses the risk of picking two words which are not  each others opposite.

When looking at gender differences it seems that women rated SQ04, SQ11, and SQ21 lower than men. It suggests that females experienced the movements of the robot more calm compared to males, but also that they find the robot less intrusive and startling.\\
When conducting a PCA on all the scale results it showed that only 53.1 \% of the total variance is explained when using the first three dimensions, which is why PCA relating to different groups such as the robot's height, distance, and direction are conducted in order to reduce the dimensions and to be able to explain more of the variance. Figure~\ref{fig:Scree} shows a Scree plot from PCA relating to the robot's height, where 94.1 \% of the variance is explained using three dimensions. Figure~\ref{fig:biplot} shows the Biplot relating to the robot's height. Similar Biplots were made for direction and distance. The attributes which loads the most on the components are:

\noindent
\textbf{Height:} SQ19 appears to contribute the most to PC1. SQ01 the most to PC2. SQ06 the most to PC3. \\
\textbf{Distance:} SQ01 appears to contribute the most to PC1 along with SQ15. SQ10 contributes most to PC2.\\
\textbf{Direction:} SQ10 contributes most to PC1. SQ22 and SQ23 contributes almost equally to PC2. SQ13 and SQ20 contributes almost equally to PC3.\\

2D and 3D Biplots from the different PCAs shows positive and negative correlations between different attributes. These correlations are presented in \autoref{tab:CorrelationsFromPCA}.

To investigate these correlations further, ratings from correlating SQs are compared, as seen in \autoref{fig:SQ12+SQ18}. Even though correlations occur when doing PCA on groupings, these plots of comparison do not take groupings into consideration. This might be why some correlations are not found when comparing SQs, even though the Biplots showed a correlation. From \autoref{fig:SQ12+SQ18} it can be seen that the robot is perceived more exciting when subjects like to be served by the robot. Attributes that have a clear correlation from this kind of comparison are shown in \autoref{tab:CorrelationsFromGraphs}.

The physical variables can be compared with SQs as well as the demographic parameters in the same manner as comparing SQs with each other, to see how these variables and parameters affect the ratings of the attributes. \autoref{fig:HeightSQ6} were SQ06 is compared with the robot's height shows that when the robot's height increases the robot is perceived as being less annoying. When comparing SQ06 with age, the younger a subject is, the more inclined one is to rate the robot as moving too slow. Also, a small negative correlation was noted in relation to how exciting and funny the robot seemed. The older the subjects were, the less exciting and funny they rated the robot. Within height the smaller the robot was the faster and more wild it was rated. This was expected, as the robot automatically moves more slowly when the height increases and faster when the height decreases. Additionally it was rated more cute, elegant, and trustworthy, regarding to wayfinding, when it was small.
