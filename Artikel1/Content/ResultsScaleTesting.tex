\section{Results - Scale Testing}
\label{ResultsScaleTesting}
%
The dataset contains several zero-answers which, due to a programming error, could happen when subjects did not answer on a scale. Two criteria were used to determine when to exclude some of the zero-points that occurred because of a non-answered scale. 1) If all scale ratings presented on one of the pages are zero, it was probably because subjects skipped a page and 2) If there is a strong tendency for high ratings on a scale and a single zero-answer seems unlikely, it was denoted as a missing answer.\\

\noindent
The different ratings on the scales in the second test are visualised on \autoref{fig:Boxplot}.

\end{figure}
\noindent
%
From \autoref{fig:Boxplot} it is notable that their exists much greater variation in some scales compared to others. For some SQ, a big part of the scale is used (1, 4, 8, 12, 14, 19), where for others a smaller part of the scale is used (2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16). Furthermore some of the scale ratings appears normal distributed (1, 2, 6, 17, 20, 21) and others appears skewed (8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 18). In some boxplot data accumulates around midpoints or terminal points (5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13). SQ5 and SQ7 are centralised around the midpoint, which can relate to the label (fine) being to broadly describing. \\ 

\noindent
When looking at gender differences SQ4 and SQ21 seems to reveal a difference. Females rate SQ4 and SQ21 twice as high as males, which means that they experience the robot's movements more calm but also more intrusive compared to males.\\

\noindent
Conducting a PCA on all the scale results in the screeplot on \autoref{fig:Scree}. It shows that only 80 \% of the variance is explained when using 7 dimensions, which is why PCA relating to different groups as the robot's height, distance and direction is conducted in order to reduce the dimensions and be able to explain more of the variance. \autoref{fig:biplot} shows the biplot relating to the robot's height. Similar biplots were made for direction and distance.

From \autoref{fig:biplot} it appears that SQ19 contributes the most to PC1 and SQ1 to PC2 relative to the robot's height. Groupings relating to distance shows that SQ1 and partly SQ15 contributes to PC1 and SQ10 contributes to PC2. For direction SQ10 contributes to PC1 and SQ22, and partly SQ1 and SQ20, contributes to PC2. Furthermore 2D and 3D biplots from the different PCAs shows positive and negative correlations between variables/scale questions. These correlations are presented in \autoref{tab:CorrelationsFromPCA}.

To investigate these correlations further ratings from correlating SQ are compared, as seen in \autoref{fig:SQ12+SQ18}. Even though correlations occur when doing PCA on groupings, these comparison does not take groupings into consideration. This might be why some correlations is not found when comparing SQ. From \autoref{fig:SQ12+SQ18} it is seen that the robot is perceived more exciting when subjects like to be served by the robot. Furthermore variables that has a clear correlation from this kind of comparison are shown in \autoref{tab:CorrelationsFromGraphs}.

In the same manner as comparing SQ with each other the physical parameters can be compared with SQ as well as the demographic parameters. \autoref{fig:HeightSQ6} shows SQ6 compared with the robot's height, which shows that when the robot's height increases the robot is percieved less annoying. Other tendenses seen from theese comparisons is {\color{red} skriv nogle eksempler fra hvordan robotten ellers perciperes med hensyn til demografi.}
