\subsection{Interview}
%Her disukterer vi interview metoderne der er anvendt 
The interview in the first test was supposed to be very open and allow the subjects to talk freely. In reality, however, it ended up being a bit more structured, with the subjects directly answering the questions they were asked and waiting for the next one. This introduced some interviewer bias, since the predetermined questions dragged the conversation in a certain direction, and meant subjects talked a lot about a specific aspect of the interaction, because they were asked directly about it.
