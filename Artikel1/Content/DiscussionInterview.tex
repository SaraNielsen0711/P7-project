When planning the interview, the idea was to let the subjects do most of the talking, in order to assess what was important to them and what was not. To extract as much information from the subjects as possible and make the conversation flow, it was decided to have some predetermined questions as a backup, in case some of the topics that seemed important in the literature remained unaddressed by the subjects. In reality, however, it became more like a semi-structured interview with the subjects waiting for the next question. This introduced some interviewer bias, since the predetermined questions dragged the conversation in a certain direction, and meant subjects talked a lot about a specific aspect of the interaction, because they were asked directly about it.
