\subsection{Interview}

When planning the interview, the idea was to let the subjects do most of the talking, in order to assess what was important to them and what was not. Not knowing how this would work, it was decided to have some predetermined questions as a backup, in case some of the topics that seemed important in the literature remained unaddressed by the participants. In reality, however, it became more like a semi-structured interview with the participants waiting for the next question. This introduced some interviewer bias, since the predetermined questions dragged the conversation in a certain direction. That meant people talked a lot about a specific aspect of the interaction, because they were asked directly about it.
