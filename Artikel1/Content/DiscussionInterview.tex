When planning the interview, the idea was to let the subjects do most of the talking, in order to assess what was important to them and what was not. Though, it was decided to have some predetermined questions as a backup, in case some of the topics that seems important in the literature remains unadressed by the participants. In reality however, it became more like a semi-structured interview, with the participients waiting for the next question. This introduces some interviewer bias, since the predetermined questions dragged the conversation in a certain direction. That means people talked a lot about a specific aspect of the interaction, because they were asked directly about it.
