\section{Part II - Scale Testing}
\label{MethodScaleTesting}
%{\color{red} Metoden for anden test beskrives i dette afsnit. Hvis der er gentagelser ift f√∏rste test vil der blot laves en henvisning til det forrige metode afsnit}
This section will describe the second part of the study where the scales were tested at AAL and in the same location as before. The purpose was to get the travellers to rate their experience with their interaction on the developed scales. Afterwards the results might show if any scales are redundant or needs to be reformulated.

%The same \textit{Double} robot with the same headmount and wireframe was used in this test. Besides that a \textit{Microsoft Surface Pro (5)} computer was used to show and collect answers from the 23 scales. To collect demographic information a sheet of paper with a few questions was used.
%\subsection{Subject Recruitment}
%43 subjects from the age of 10 to 72 years (M=40.1, SD=13.4) distributed among 16 females and 27 males participated. The subjects were recruited with the same procedure and with the same questions in this test as in the previous. 
%\subsection{Roles}
%Four researchers were present during the test at AAL. One controlled the \textit{Double} robot, one got the subjects to answer on the scales, one kept an eye on when the robot should start leading the subjects towards duty free and one noted the physical parameters of the robot.
