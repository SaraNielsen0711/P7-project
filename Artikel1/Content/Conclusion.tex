The research conducted in this study shows four categories of variables found to describe the user experience of a social robot in Aalborg Airport (AAL). Each of the variables are formulated as scale questions with belong scale to be used in a upcoming study. New variables were found compared to previous conducted studies. The results of the study are context dependent and based en the specific location and test design. It is not expected to transfer the results to other contexts without further testing. 

The study is usable in development of a robot for AAL, where the variables found in this study can be used to evaluate the user experience of the robot. The variables found in this study could also be tested to determine the design for the optimal user experience measured on the scales of this study. 

%The conclusion aims to answer the following questions: \\
%What Has Your Research Shown?\\
%How Has It Added to What is Known About the Subject?\\
%What Were the Shortcomings?\\
%Has Your Research Left Some Unanswered Questions?\\
%Are My Results of Any Use in the Real World?

%\subsection{Future work}
%During the next month, the evaluation of the scales in the airport will take place. This involves creating the scales from the results of the affinity diagram, bringing the robot to the airport, letting people interact with it, and measuring their experience on the developed scales and analyzing the results
