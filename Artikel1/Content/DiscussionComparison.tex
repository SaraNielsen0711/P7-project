\subsection{Comparison}
%Her sammenligner vi vores resultater med andre studiers resultater. 
When comparing the parameters from our study with parameters from other studys done on social robots, parameters like distance, antromorphism, height, speed, movement, trust, and usefulness overlaps. The new parameters found in our study under apperance is elegance. Under behaviour the new parameters found is how annoying and intrusive the robot is, and how calm and plesant movements are. Looking at approach new parameters include how inviting, intimidating and surprising the approach is, if it's you or the robot who approach, and if the robot was blocking the way. Looking at trust only one new parameter was discovered; if the robot scared you. These parameters are overall parameters
