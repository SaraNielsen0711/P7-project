 Some of the new variables which was elicitaded from the test might only appear because the test was conducted at AAL, where the \textit{Double 1} robot can help with specific tasks and are not variables which can easily be adjusted by a designer. Though this might be true, the variables can be used in scales and checked for correlation with the variables which can easily be adjusted. If a correlation occurs the overall subjective experience might be improved by changing physical easily adjustable parameters, for example height. Furthermore these variables are considered to be important for travelers at AAL and can be used when evaluating a social robot in this specific context.
