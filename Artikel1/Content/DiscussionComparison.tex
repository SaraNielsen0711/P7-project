\subsection{Context}

 Some of the attributes which were elicited might only appear because the study was conducted at AAL, where the \textit{Double} robot helped with specific tasks. These attributes are considered to be important for travellers at AAL and can be used when evaluating a social robot in this specific context. However, these are not attributes which can easily be adjusted by a designer such as how the subjects perceive the robot (elegant, cute, welcoming, etc.). Though this might be true, it is found that the robot was rated more cute, elegant, and trustworthy, regarding to wayfinding, when it was small. On the basis of these correlations the subjective experience might be improved by changing physical, easily adjustable characteristics such as height.
