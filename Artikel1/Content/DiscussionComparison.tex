\subsection{Context}

 Some of the new variables which was elicited from the test might only appear because the test was conducted at AAL, where the \textit{Double 1} robot can help with specific tasks and are not variables which can easily be adjusted by a designer such as how the subjects perceive the robot (elegant, scary, welcoming etc.). Though this might be true, the variables can be used in scales and checked for correlation with the variables which can easily be adjusted. If a correlation occurs the overall subjective experience might be improved by changing physical easily adjustable parameters, for example height. Furthermore these variables are considered to be important for travellers at AAL and can be used when evaluating a social robot in this specific context.
