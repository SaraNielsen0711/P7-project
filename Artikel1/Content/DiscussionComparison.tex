When comparing the variables for HRI found in this study with variables for HRI from previous conducted studies on social robots \cite{PDF:ExploringInfluencingVariable},\cite{PDF:SharingALifeHarvey},\cite{PDF:HowMayIServeYou},\cite{PDF:CloseButNotStuck},\cite{PDF:TheImpactOfTraveler},\cite{PDF:HumanRobotEmodiedInteraction},\cite{PDF:RecommendationEffects}, variables like distance, anthropomorphism, height, speed, movement, trust, and usefulness recur. 

New variables found under appearance, in this study compared with previous mentioned studies, is elegance. Under behavior the new variables found is how annoying and intrusive the robot is, and how calm and pleasant the movements of the robot are. Looking at approach the new variables include how inviting, intimidating and surprising the approach is, if it is either the person or the robot who approaches, and if the robot was blocking the way. Looking at trust only one new variable was discovered; if the robot scared you. Some of these variables might only appear because the test was conducted at AAL, where the \textit{Double 1} robot can help with specific tasks, and are not variables which can easily be adjusted by a designer. These variables are considered to be important for travelers at AAL and can be used when evaluating a social robot in this specific context.
