 Some of the new attributes which were elicited might only appear because the study was conducted at AAL, where the \textit{Double} robot helped with specific tasks. These attributes are considered to be important for travellers at AAL and can be used when evaluating a social robot in this specific contect. However, these are not attributes which can easily be adjusted by a designer such as how the subjects perceive the robot (elegant, cute, welcoming, etc.). Though this might be true, it is found that the robot was rated more cute, elegant, and trustworthy, regarding to wayfinding, when it was small. On the basis of these correlations the subjective experience might be improved by changing physical, easily adjustable charachteristics such as height.

 
% Some of the new variables which were elicited might only appear because the study was conducted at AAL, where the \textit{Double} robot helped with specific tasks. These are not variables which can easily be adjusted by a designer such as how the subjects perceive the robot (elegant, being startled, welcoming, etc.). Though this might be true, the variables can be used in scales and checked for correlation with the variables which can easily be adjusted. If a correlation occurs the overall subjective experience might be improved by changing physical easily adjustable characteristics, e.g. height. Furthermore these variables are considered to be important for travellers at AAL and can be used when evaluating a social robot in this specific context.
