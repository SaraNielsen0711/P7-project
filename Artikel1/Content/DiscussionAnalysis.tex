\subsection{Analysis}
%Her skriver vi om biases ved v√¶res databehandling
Both spontaneous statements, answers to specific questions, and observations were all analyzed together in an affinity diagram. The three types of data are different, where spontaneous statements are the users own words and areas of interest. The subjects did not give as many spontaneous answers as hoped, hence all answers and observations were analysed together to gain more insight. Answers to specific questions were based on predetermined areas of interest by the authors and the wording of the users was biased by the wording of the questions. The observations are entirely the authors wording and is possible biased by the authors knowledge and expectations when interpreting the meaning of the observed behavior.
