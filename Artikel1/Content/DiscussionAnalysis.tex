Both spontaneous answers, answers to specific questions, and observations were all analyzed together in an affinity diagram. The three types of data are different, where spontaneous answers are the subjects own words and areas of interest. The subjects did not provide as many spontaneous answers as hoped, hence all answers and observations were analyzed together to gain more insight. Answers to specific questions were based on predetermined areas of interest by the authors and the wording of the subjects would potentially be biased by the wording of the questions asked. The observations were entirely the authors wording and thus possible biased by the authors knowledge and expectations when interpreting the meaning of the observed behavior.
