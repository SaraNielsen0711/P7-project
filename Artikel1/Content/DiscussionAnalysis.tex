Spontaneous answers, answers to specific questions, and observations were all analysed together in an affinity diagram. It could be considered to treat the data differently in relation to where it comes from eg. spontaneous answers are processed in parallel with answers to specific questions and the observation notes. The reason being that spontaneous answers are the subjects' own words and areas of interest. The subjects did not provide as many spontaneous answers as hoped, hence all answers and observations were analysed together to gain more insight. Answers to specific questions were based on predetermined areas of interest by the authors and the wording of the subjects would potentially be biased by the wording of the questions asked. The observations were entirely the authors' wording and thus possibly biased by the authors knowledge and expectations when interpreting the meaning of the observed behaviour.
