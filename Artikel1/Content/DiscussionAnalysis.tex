\subsection{Treatment of data}
%Her skriver vi om biases ved v√¶res databehandling
In the first test spontaneous answers, answers to specific questions, and observations were all analysed together in an affinity diagram. It could be argued that these answers are two different categories, where only the spontaneous answers are the subjects' own words and areas of interest. The subjects did not provide as many spontaneous answers as hoped, hence all answers and observations were analysed together to gain more insight. 
%Answers to specific questions were based on predetermined areas of interest by the authors and the wording of the subjects would potentially be biased by the wording of the questions asked. The observations were entirely the authors' wording and thus possibly biased by the authors knowledge and expectations when interpreting the meaning of the observed behaviour.
In the second test it was chosen to exclude some zeros from the dataset because of incomplete scale responses. This was decided due to a programming error which allowed the subjects to continue to the next scale questions without the software having registered a response on one or more scales. If a scale was not answered the software returned 0, which also was a valid scale response for the subjects. After looking over the data it was decided to remove some of the zeros which seemed to stem from the unresponsive software bug. This might have led to real zero-responses being excluded from the dataset.
