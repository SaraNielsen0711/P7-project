In the first test spontaneous answers, answers to specific questions, and observations were all analysed together in an affinity diagram. It could be argued that these answers are two different categories, where only the spontaneous answers are the subjects' own words and areas of interest. The subjects did not provide as many spontaneous answers as hoped, hence all answers and observations were analysed together to gain more insight. 

If a scale was not answered in the second test the software returned 0, which also was a valid scale response for the subjects. After looking through the data it was decided to remove some of the zeros, which seemed to stem from the unresponsive software bug. This might have led to real zero-responses being excluded from the dataset and for missing answers being included.
