%
First check for stochastic transitivity violations, WST, MST, SST. (there is no Matlab function for this, so youâ€™ll have to do some programming yourself)How good a fit does your solution have? (interpret the result of the chi-square test).What does your analysis show? (Plot your scale values and 95\% confidence intervals).
