The number for SST violations is quit big, it is 25, because of that it is very unlikely that any model will fit. The number of WST violations is only two and this could give the possibility of rank ordering. 
%First check for stochastic transitivity violations, WST, MST, SST. (there is no Matlab function for this, so youâ€™ll have to do some programming yourself)
%How good a fit does your solution have? (interpret the result of the chi-square test).
%What does your analysis show? (Plot your scale values and 95\% confidence intervals).
