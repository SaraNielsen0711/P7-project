The analysis did not show uniquely that the BTL-model fits. Even though the results from the Chi-square test showed that the BTL-model could be accepted, the number of SST violations was a bit to big. Ideally this number should be as close to zero as possible. 

On the positive side the number of WST and MST violations were both small (two and three) and that makes it more possible that the BTL-model might fit. 

It would be relevant to explore other methods or models that would fit better.
