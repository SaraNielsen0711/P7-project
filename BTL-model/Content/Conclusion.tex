The data from \textcite{Ellermeier2004} were analyzed by using the BTL-model. Based on both the results namely the number of WST violations and the Chi-square test, presented in \fullref{Results}, and the analysis, presented in \fullref{Analyse}, it can be concluded that the BTL-model sufficiently describe the collected data. According to \autoref{fig:Confidens} it is obvious that the jackhammer is the absolute most unpleasant sound of the ten otherwise unpleasant sounds.
