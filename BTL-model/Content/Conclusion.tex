The data from \textcite{Ellermeier2004} is analyzed by using the BTL-model. The results from the analysis shows that according the Chi-square test, the model could be accepted, but the number of SST violations at 25 is a bit to big. Because of that, i would be relevant to explore other methods or models for the optimal analysis of the data.
